    """This matcher is provided to help those who need to use Digest Auth.

    .. note::

        The code requests 2.0.1 uses to generate this header is different from
        the code that every requests version after it uses. Specifically, in
        2.0.1 one of the parameters is ``qop=auth`` and every other version is
        ``qop="auth"``. Given that there's also an unsupported type of ``qop``
        in requests, I've chosen not to ignore ore sanitize this. All
        cassettes recorded on 2.0.1 will need to be re-recorded for any
        requests version after it.

        This matcher also ignores the ``cnonce`` and ``response`` parameters.
        These parameters require the system time to be monkey-patched and
        that is out of the scope of betamax
